# round-sim
Code to simulate OH semi-finals at worlds. Could be used for other stuff. Could be improved.

The R code makes use of the "get_person_times" stored procedure in MySQL. You will need to download the WCA database to get at this.

The Excel spreadsheet "WorldsOHTop80" was unbelievably miserable to get right. Always double check whether or not everyone copied over, as well as whether or not there are multiple people with the same name. Surely there's a better way but I was too lazy to do it.
